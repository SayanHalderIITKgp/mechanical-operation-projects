# Mechanical-Operation-Projects


Here I have done three projects.

Created a simulation type of program with the help of python and it's libraries for Particle Characterization using Sieve Analysis from an International Standard Screen (Taylor Series) based on some given examples and references.

Created a code by python language on Oversized and Undersized particles based on some proper (exemplary)mesh number and calculate the Recovery Rate, Rejection percentage and Effectiveness using python commands and libraries.

Checking the validity of Bond's Law, Rittinger's Law and Kick's law for the same dimensional particles of quartz using two specific types of grinders . Also computed the actual power required by an individual grinder.
